## Impressions

 Codebase was well written and in-line comments were good. Design structures where setup to be secure by default indicating good contract design. The only major portion missing was secondary documentation. A majority of issues were very small oversights and were quick fixes. Codebase was very secure given the quick dev time, which indicates competent and skilled developers.
